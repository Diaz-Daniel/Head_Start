## The Spirit of the Project

Time is of the essence and automating the creation of a README helps shorten the path between an idea and full fledged project. Having a high quality README is important so that future employers or contributors can clearly see how your project is set up and have an understanding of how to successfuly contribute if they wish.

## Goal of the Project

This project is meant to show a clear grasp of Node.js basics by creating a command line application that generates a professional README.md file from a users input.
